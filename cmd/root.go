	Short: "Warehouse Management System",
	Long: `It is a software application designed to facilitate efficient management and tracking of inventory within a warehouse setting. 
This server acts as the backend infrastructure, providing REST APIs that enable seamless communication between the front-end applications and the warehouse management system

Key features of the "Warehouse Management System Rest Resource API Server" include:
1. Inventory Management: The API server allows users to create, update, and retrieve information about products and their quantities stored in the warehouse. It enables real-time tracking of inventory levels, ensuring accurate stock management.
2. Order Processing: The server handles order processing, allowing users to place orders, manage order status, and generate order reports. It ensures smooth order fulfillment and provides insights into order history.
3. Location Tracking: The API server facilitates location tracking within the warehouse, helping users quickly locate specific items and optimize storage space.
4. Data Analytics: It offers data analytics capabilities to generate reports, visualize trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve warehouse operations and efficiency.
5. REST API Design: The server follows REST API design principles, making it easy for developers to interact with the system using standard HTTP methods and well-defined endpoints.
6. Scalability and Performance: The API server is built with scalability and performance in mind, ensuring that it can handle a large number of concurrent requests and maintain high availability.
7. Integration Capabilities: It supports integration with other systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, point-of-sale systems, and shipping carriers, enabling seamless data synchronization and efficient workflows.`,
